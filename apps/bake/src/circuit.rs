//! A racing circuit's scene, built from its track: the island it runs round, the road, and
//! everything beside it.
//!
//! The track file (`solstice_game::track`) says where the centre line runs, how wide the road
//! is, and what lies either side. From that alone this builds:
//!
//! * **The land**: an island whose broad height follows the road's, with cliffs to the east and
//!   beaches round the rest, a wooded hill in the middle, and stacks of rock standing in the
//!   sea. It is drawn level with the road wherever the road passes, so that the road lies in
//!   the land rather than on it. Grass over most of it, rock where it is steep, sand at the
//!   water.
//! * **The road**: asphalt, with a white line down each edge, the start line, and grid marks;
//!   kerbs in red and white; gravel traps and concrete where the track file has them.
//! * **Barriers** a way back from each edge, which are also what a car is stopped by.
//! * **Planting**: grass along the verges, woods beyond the barriers, boulders on the shore.
//!
//! The ground a car drives on is the same land, as a grid of heights. The game reads what is
//! under each tyre from the same track file, so what is drawn and what is driven on agree.
