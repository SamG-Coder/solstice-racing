//! Play mode: a scene's game, running.

//! [`Play::load`] builds a world from a baked scene's gameplay files: an entity for each placed
//! actor, with its name, its place, and its script with the placement's property values. Each
//! frame, [`Play::frame`] runs the game, then says where to draw each actor's instances, between
//! the last two steps, and where the player's camera is.
