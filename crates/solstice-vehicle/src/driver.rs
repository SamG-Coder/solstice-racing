//! Between the player's hands and the car: what a key or a stick is turned into.
//!
//! A steering wheel turns through more than a turn, and a pedal through a foot's travel. A key
//! is up or down, and a thumbstick moves two centimetres. Handing either to the car as it comes
//! would make it undrivable, so every driving game puts something between them:
//!
//! * **Steering eases** towards what is asked rather than jumping there, and the faster the car
//!   goes the less lock a full push gives: just past the angle at which the front tyres grip
//!   best at that speed. A full push then asks for all the cornering there is, and no more.
//! * **The wheel follows a slide.** A real steering wheel is pulled round by the front tyres
//!   towards the way the car is going: let go of it in a slide and it steers into the slide by
//!   itself, and a driver's hands follow it without thinking. Keys and sticks have no such
//!   pull, so it is done here: past a few degrees of slide, the wheel turns towards where the
//!   car is going, by a little more than it has slid.
//! * **Pedals ease** too: a key pressed is a foot going down, in a fifth of a second.
//! * **The gearbox** can change gear by itself, and finds reverse when the car is held on the
//!   brake at a standstill.
//!
//! None of it alters what the car does: it only decides what the wheel and pedals are doing.
