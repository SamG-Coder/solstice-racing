//! The tyre: what force it makes for how much it slips.
//!
//! A tyre grips by slipping. Rolling faster or slower than the road passes under it (the slip
//! ratio) pushes the car along or holds it back; pointing a little away from where it is going
//! (the slip angle) pushes it sideways. Each force rises steeply with slip, peaks, and then falls
//! away as the tyre slides. That shape is Pacejka's Magic Formula (Pacejka, *Tyre and Vehicle
//! Dynamics*), used here in the form where the curve is fixed by where its peak is and how high.
//!
//! * **One budget for both.** Braking and cornering share the tyre's grip. The two slips are
//!   scaled by where each one peaks and combined into one, which sets how much force there is;
//!   the force then points against the slip. This is the similarity method (Pacejka, ch. 4;
//!   Milliken, *Race Car Vehicle Dynamics*, ch. 2), and it gives the friction ellipse.
//! * **Load sensitivity.** A tyre pressed twice as hard grips less than twice as well. That is
//!   why weight transfer costs grip, and why a car's balance follows its roll stiffness.

/// The Magic Formula scaled to peak at 1 where the slip is 1:
/// `sin(C atan(Bx - E (Bx - atan(Bx))))`.
///
/// `C` sets how far the force falls once the tyre slides: far out, it tends to `sin(C π/2)`.
/// `E` bends the curve around its peak: lower is sharper.
